# [SourceSnippet](https://sourcesnippet.github.io/)

A website for storing reusable code segements

## How does it work?

All the .mdx files are stored inside `main` branch and have corresponding .html files which are generated in the `site` branch

These .html are then statically hosted via [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
