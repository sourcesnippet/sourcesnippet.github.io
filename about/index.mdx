# About

We've all found ourselves scouring decades old forums to salvage code or having our **[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** question [closed] or finding what we were looking for only to see it ended up being deleted.
This site was made to solve all those problems & save your valuable time by giving you reuseable bite size snippets of code, Along with the following promises:  

<br/>

1. No Ads or Selling you courses
1. No Subscriptions or Paywall
1. No Cookies or Data tracking
1. No forced AI
1. No Feature Bloat or UI Clutter

<br/>
<br/>

Just because you're programming doesn't mean everything needs to be complicated.  
So simply copy the damn code & leave.
